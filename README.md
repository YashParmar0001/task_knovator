# task_knovator

## Flutter Task

I've used BLoC for state management

I've used sqflite for local database, http for network request

### How to run the Project

I've used Flutter version 3.22.3, It should be installed on your machine.

Then run 'pub get' to get all the dependencies and run 'flutter --run' to run the application
